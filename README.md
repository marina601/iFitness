    content available: Home, About, Services, Team and Sign Up tabs.

  - When clicked on each tab it takes you to the relevent section.

  - On the medium and small screen sizes the logo becomes a hamburger button which opens and closes by pressing on the button. 
  Once the button is pressed and the menu is open all the links become available to use.

#### Sign-up Form 

   - Sign up form consists of 4 input field for first name, last name, passowrd and repeat password. 

    - All the input fields have a required attribute added to them.

    - If one of the attributes is missing then 'Fill out this field' message appears.

    - Submit button has been changed to 'Become a member button', nothing happens when the button is pressed,
    as per MS1 crietirea the method in the form element has not been specified. 

#### Services 

   - When testing a responsive design for services section on the large screen view
     all services are in line occupying full screen view in 4 different part.

  - Using Bootstrap grid system I was able to adjust the layout of services on ipad screen to 
     4 different coloms first 2 colums side by side and the other 2 colums side by side underneath the first two. 

  - For mobile design I have desided to use single colomn for each service to give the user good 
     content overview and not  minimize the size of the content for the user to make it difficult to read and understant.

#### Team 
    
  - Using the Bootstrap grid system the layout on the large screen size is shown 
    3 colums side by side.

  - When the content is viewed on the medium screen size there is only 2 columns side by side and the 
    third column wraps underneath in the middle of the page.

  - For mobile design I have desided to use single colomn for each team to give the user good 
     content overview and not  minimize the size of the content for the user to make it difficult to read and understant.

#### Footer 

   - Footer element in the large screen view has contact information on the left had side, and 
    social links on the right hand side. I have also designed a logo image in the middle to promote the brand. 

  - The appearance of logo image did not look good on the medium screen view, therefore the items had to be 
    re-aranged and the logo is hidden.

  - Mobile screen view the logo is hidden as well, the contact information appears in the middle of the screen and 
    the social links at the bottom.

  - Footer elements were custom written for each screen view size using media query.

### Bugs

#### Timetable

  - When viewed on the mobile device the table content seemed to be larger then the screen view. 

  - The custome margin did not center the table and had to be inclueded in the media queries. 

  - To solve this issue I had to tackle and resize each element of the table and add a media 
     quire:


     #timetable {
        max-width: 80%;
    }

    .table-title tr th {
      padding-left: 0px;
      padding-right: 0px;
      margin-right: 0px;
      margin-left: 0px;

    }

    .table-border tr th {
      padding-left: 0px;
      padding-right: 0px;
      margin-left: 0px;
      margin-right: 0px;
    }

    .table {
        margin: 0px;
    }

    .table-border td {
      padding-left: 0px;
      padding-right: 0px;
    }

    #timetable h2 {
        padding-left: 90px;
    }

    #timetable p {
        padding-left: 80px;
        margin: 10px auto;
        padding-right: 0px;
    }

    .table-responsive-sm {
        margin: 10px auto;
        padding-left: 30px;
    }

    td {
        padding-left: 0px;
        padding-right: 0px;
    }

#### Page width 

- When vied the site, the content appeared to be smaller and did not take up a full 
screen view. 

- Using bootstrap library for Grid System I have used a class of container-fluid to ensure 
the full screen was covered in content. 

- I have tried to look at the background image to see if it had any padding or margins, also I 
have taken all the padding and margins from <section> element. 

- Finally, class="container-fluid" was looked at and I have removed the padding from the container
which let me have a full screen view width of my website. 

.container-fluid {
    padding-left: 0px;
    padding-right: 0px;
}
